    <h2>UN launches campaign, calling for renewed global ambition and action for the Sustainable Development Goals</h2>
    <h2>Public mobilization comes ahead of critical halftime Summit in September at UN in New York</h2>
    <p><em>New York, 5 July 2023</em>- The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to rally for the Sustainable Development Goals <b>(SDGs)</b>, the roadmap for people and planet adopted by world leaders in 2015. Ahead of a critical <b><abbr class="abbr" title="United Nations">UN</abbr></b> Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda for our common future.</p>
    <p>At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="Sustainable Development Goals ">SDGs</abbr></b> is in peril. For the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.</p>
    <p>The 2023 <b><abbr class="abbr" title="Sustainable Development Goals ">SDG</abbr></b> Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="Sustainable Development Goals ">SDGs</abbr></b>.</p>
    <p>Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="United Nations">UN</abbr></b> campaign aims to re-energize the conversation about the Goals.</p>
    <hr class="hr">
    <blockquote class="texto"><p>"We want to get everyone on board for the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="Sustainable Development Goals ">SDGs</abbr></b>". "Our hope is that decisionmakers and individual citizens alike will feel inspired to join the conversation and contribute to achieving the Goals with new resolve and ambition."</p>
    <p><em>Nanette Braun, Director of Campaigns in the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="United Nations">UN</abbr></b> Department for Global Communications.</em></p></blockquote>
    <hr class="hr2">
    <p>Building off the color wheel brand of the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="Sustainable Development Goals ">SDGs</abbr></b>, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for its messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="Sustainable Development Goals ">SDGs</abbr></b>.</p>
    <p>One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the <b>SDGs</b> through the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="United Nations">UNâ€™</abbr></b> ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="Sustainable Development Goals ">SDGs</abbr></b> and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.</p>
    <p>A curated group of high-profile influencers from entertainment, sports and beyond, the Circle of Supporters, will galvanize their social media communities with a combined reach of more than 80 million globally to take individual action on the <b><abbr class="abbr" title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b> and to impress upon decisionmakers the urgency to act now.</p>
